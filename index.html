                <b>RESTFul API:</b> <br>
                API Name: Polygon.io
                Justification: Polygon.io is a verbose, fast stock API that provides real time & historical data on US
                stocks. Alongside that, it provides a javascript client library that is well documented. Other popular
                stock
                applications and websites utilize this API as well.
                <br><br>
                <b>Insight and Information for end user:</b> <br>
                The API we choose needs to be able to
                Provide real time data on the current price of stocks
                Provide detailed information on a stock
                With this information, weâ€™ll be able to provide insights on the stocks that the end-user may want to
                track
                or invest in. Alongside that, this information can be used to track the potential gains or losses the
                end-user has made.

                Our web app will allow users to visualize this data for multiple stocks on one graph allowing them to
                gain
                insight on patterns and trends. We will also allow visualization of different time periods of the same
                stock
                on a single chart to give users insight on potential annual patterns.
