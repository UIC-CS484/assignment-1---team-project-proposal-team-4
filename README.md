# Team Workflow Strategy

- Our main branch will be used for production.
- The only 2 branches that can merge into production will be hotfixes and releases
- Releases can only be merged into by Development
- Development will be working branch which allows merging from feature branches
- Feature branches will be where we develop specific functionality of our site
- These will them be merged into Development after a code review
- After enough progress has been made in the Development Branch, it will merge into Releases and then into Main
- Our team will work on everything in the Fullstack in order to help all of us build relevant experience
